    <h2>When &quot;Vibe Coding&quot; Stopped Being a Joke</h2>
<p>The first time I heard the term <em>vibe coding</em>, I rolled my eyes. Hard. It sounded like one of those Silicon Valley buzzwords that belong on a hoodie, not in a serious workflow. But then people started using it in earnest: large language models (LLMs) that take your intent, your &quot;vibe,&quot; and turn it into working code.</p>
<p>At first my reaction was pure cynicism:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Sure, let’s see what amazing products you can ship with that. Maybe add &quot;vibes&quot; as a skill on LinkedIn— endorsed by your dog.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Then cynicism softened into skepticism:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Okay, code is text, so it makes sense. But there’s no way you can build a real, usable app this way.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Then came curiosity. And then, inevitability.</p>
<h2>The Acceleration Effect</h2>
<p>Once I gave LLMs a real place in my workflow, the change was dizzying. I went from idea to working MVP (minimum viable product) in days, sometimes hours. A few iterations on a database design and schema that used to take a week? Now done before lunch. A working full-stack app? Spin it up in a weekend.</p>
<p>The dopamine hits were real. Shipping has always been my fuel, but now the frequency dial is turned to 11.</p>
<p>I also realized: this works best for people with a certain skill mix. I have just enough coding background, product leadership, and architecture experience to see both the limitations and the magic. The tech doesn’t replace expertise; <strong>it amplifies it.</strong></p>
<h2>From Shipping Code to Shaping Design</h2>
<p>The surprise upside of this acceleration: time. With LLMs covering ground I used to sweat over, I can invest in skills I always wanted but never had bandwidth for.</p>
<p>Design has always been that itch. I know good from bad design, but I’ve never been great at it. In the past, it felt smarter to double down where I already had strengths—coding, architecture, product strategy. Design was always the &quot;maybe someday&quot; skill.</p>
<p>Now I’m experimenting. I feed wireframes, PRDs (product requirement documents), and text prompts into AI design tools. The results? Mostly disappointing. Lovable and similar platforms can spin up a decent landing page, but they all feel cookie-cutter. Different wrappers, same vibe.</p>
<p>Maybe that’s because <em>vibe designing</em> isn’t really here yet. If vibe coding was v1.0, maybe vibe designing is still just a next step on our collective roadmap.</p>
<h2>Why I’m Still Learning Design the Old-Fashioned Way</h2>
<p>Here’s the kicker: I don’t think skipping design fundamentals is smart, even if AI tools eventually nail it. When vibe designing arrives, it’ll be like vibe coding: a massive amplifier. If I know the principles of proportions, color theory, and composition, then when the tools get good, I’ll be in the same sweet spot I am with coding now.</p>
<p>So I’m picking up design the slow way—and I’m enjoying it. Sketching, studying, comparing. Not because AI won’t get better, because, oh yeah, it will. But because I want to be ready when it does.</p>
<h2>Lessons Learned</h2>
<ul>
<li>Buzzwords are annoying—until they’re not.</li>
<li>AI tools don’t replace expertise, they multiply it.</li>
<li>Speed creates space. What you do with that space matters.</li>
<li>Cookie-cutter designs highlight the gap between automation and originality.</li>
<li>Investing in fundamentals now means bigger leverage later.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Next Steps</h2>
<p>I’ll keep experimenting with AI design tools, but I’ll also keep learning the craft itself. If vibe designing takes off, I want to be someone who doesn’t just push the button—I want to shape what comes out of it.</p>
<p>And honestly? It feels like an amazing time to be alive</p>
<p>— <strong>Builders and dreamers, the future is very much hiring.</strong></p>
