# About

Imagine a Twitter...

Where you never have to scroll past manufactured outrage, smear jobs, or someone’s latest “gotcha” politics.  
Where it doesn’t matter if you call it Twitter or “X,” and nobody mistakes it for your ex.  

Imagine an Instagram with no ads.  
One where you never unmute a post by mistake, so John Lennon doesn’t suddenly start playing, and you’re not left frantically swiping only to land on Rick Astley at full volume.  

Now picture a platform where:  
- You **don’t care** about likes, retweets, or comments.  
- Nobody can jump into your thread and **ruin your day.**
- Everything you’ve posted is right where you left it, **easy to find.**

That platform already exists.  
It’s called **a blog**.  

Welcome to mine.
