This is an example blog post written in **Markdown**. You can use all the standard Markdown features:

## Headings

### Subheadings work too

You can write *italic* and **bold** text.

## Lists

- Item 1
- Item 2
- Item 3

### Numbered lists

1. First item
2. Second item
3. Third item

## Code

Here's some inline `code` and a code block:

```javascript
function greet(name) {
    console.log(`Hello, ${name}!`);
}
```

## Links and Images

You can add [links](https://example.com) and reference images.

This post demonstrates how easy it is to write content in Markdown and have it automatically converted to HTML with your existing styling.
